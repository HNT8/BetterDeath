# BetterDeath

<b>BetterRevive</b> is a redesigned version of [FAX Revive](https://github.com/FAXES/fax-revive) but modernized. It has basically the same functionality as [FAX Revive](https://github.com/FAXES/fax-revive) but with a redesigned respawning system. When attempting to respawn by pressing ``R``, a menu will popup containing possible spawns that the player can choose. Cooldowns and spawns can be added, removed, or changed by editing ``config.lua``

## Dependencies
<b>BetterRevive</b> requires [dpEmotes](https://forum.cfx.re/t/dpemotes-1-7-390-emotes-walkingstyles-keybinding-dances-expressions-and-shared-emotes/843105) ([repo](https://github.com/andristum/dpemotes)) in order to assign the player an animation when respawning. If this is not included on your server, errors may occur.
